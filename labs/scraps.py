# Oh hey you're back! Winston is joining us and he also brought his friend Shelby!
# Say hi to Shelby! She'll be helping us learn about abstraction this week.

# You can control Winston and Shelby separately! Try making Winston and Shelby draw a square each.
# It's kind of hard to tell Winston and Shelby apart, so make them different colors before they start drawing too.

# Remeber that Winston and Shelby are different turtles so calling 1 command on Winston won't do anything to Shelby and vice versa!
