      <td class="question">What will I actually learn from this course?</td>
      <td class="answer">You will learn Python, our favorite programming language for just Getting
        Stuff Done. You'll start by drawing a bunch of things with turtle graphics,
        which is built into Python for learning purposes. About halfway through the
        course, we'll dive into realer world applications such as web scraping, data
        processing, and writing your own simple website.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">Will you teach me to make my website beautiful?</td>
      <td class="answer">Unfortunately, no. Though we'll touch on web development, we will NOT be
      teaching you how to make a nice-looking website, aka web design. For that, the
      folks over at
      <a href="http://www.thewebdesignworkshop.co" target="_blank">The Web Design Workshop</a>
      seem to know what they're doing.</td>
