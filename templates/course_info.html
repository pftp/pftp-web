  Hello! You look like you want to learn to write code. We know how, and we want
  to guide you. Why? Because we think it's important that you understand the
  computing devices that are omnipresent in all of our lives. Because the demand
  for quality computer scientists in this world is outpacing supply, and you can
  help bridge the gap. And, most of all, because coding is a ton of fun once you
  get the hang of it.

  <div class="faq_header">What will I actually learn from this course?</div>
  <p>
  You will learn Python, our favorite programming language for just Getting
  Stuff Done. You'll start by drawing a bunch of things with turtle graphics,
  which is built into Python for learning purposes. About halfway through the
  course, we'll dive into realer world applications such as web scraping, data
  processing, and writing your own simple website.

  <div class="faq_header">Will you teach me to make my website beautiful?</div>
  <p>
  Unfortunately, no. Though we'll touch on web development, we will NOT be
  teaching you how to make a nice-looking website, aka web design. For that, the
  folks over at
  <a href="http://www.thewebdesignworkshop.co">The Web Design Workshop</a>
  seem to know what they're doing.
