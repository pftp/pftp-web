### prompt
Write a function called is_leap_year(year) that takes in a year as an input and returns True if the year is a leap year and returns False if the year is not a leap year. Remember years that are divisible by 4 are leap years, with the exception that years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years, with the exception that years that are divisible by 400 are leap years. Then test your function by executing "print is_leap_year(2000)", "print is_leap_year(2012)", "print is_leap_year(2013)", "print is_leap_year(2100)".

### solution
def is_leap_year(year):
  if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
    return True
  return False
print is_leap_year(2000)
print is_leap_year(2012)
print is_leap_year(2013)
print is_leap_year(2100)

### test
print is_leap_year(200)
print is_leap_year(201)
print is_leap_year(202)
print is_leap_year(2200)
print is_leap_year(2400)
### hint
Here's code for the add_two function which takes two integers as
arguments and returns their sum:
<pre>
def add_two(x, y):
  return x + y
</pre>
