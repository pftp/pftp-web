### prompt
Write a function called capitalize_every_{{ nth }} that takes a string as its
argument and returns a new version of it with every {{ nth }} character
capitalized, starting with the first character. Any non-letter character should
remain unchanged.

### solution
def capitalize_every_{{ nth }}(s):
  res = ''
  for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if i % {{ n }} == 0:
      res += char.upper()
    else:
      res += char
  return res

### test
print capitalize_every_{{ nth }}('')
for x in {{ xs }}:
  print capitalize_every_{{ nth }}(x)

### hint
Here's code for lowercase_every_3rd which takes a string as its
argument and returns a new version of it with every 3rd character
lowercase, starting with the first character:
<pre>
def lowercase_every_3rd(s):
  res = ''
  for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if i % 3 == 0:
      res += char.lower()
    else:
      res += char
  return res
</pre>

### gen_template_vars
n = rand_int(2, 5)
res = {
  'xs': rand_string_list(20),
  'n': n,
  'nth': nth(n)
}
