join function
<p>
The <b>split function</b> breaks a string into a list of words. By default, any
 number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary:
</p>
<pre>
>>> song = "The rain in Spain..."
>>> print song.split()
['The', 'rain', 'in', 'Spain...']
</pre>
<p>
An optional argument called a delimiter can be used to specify which characters
to use as word boundaries. The following example uses the string 'ai' as the
delimiter:
</p>
<pre>
>>> print song.split('ai')
['The r', 'n in Sp', 'n...']
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the delimiter doesn't appear in the list.
</p>
<p>
The <b>join function</b> is the inverse of split. You call it on a delimiter
string, and it takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements with that
delimiter between each pair:
</p>
<pre>
>>> list = ['The', 'rain', 'in', 'Spain...']
>>> print ' '.join(list)
The rain in Spain...
</pre>
<p>
We can specify any string as our delimiter to insert between elements:
</p>
<pre>
>>> print '_'.join(list)
'The_rain_in_Spain...'
</pre>
<p>
As an exercise, describe the relationship between ' '.join(song.split()) and song. Are they the same for all strings? When would they be different?
