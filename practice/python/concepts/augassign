augmented assignment
The <b>augmented assignment statement</b> updates a variable to take
on a new value:
<pre>
sentence = 'Don't worry, be '   # Normal assignment statement
sentence += 'happy'             # Appends the string "happy" to the end of sentence
count += 1                      # Increments count by 1
product *= count                # Multiplies product by count
</pre>
<p>
We pronounce these new operators "plus equals" and "times equals".
We can "augment" the equals sign with any arithmetic operand on the left,
so our "augmented assignment" operators in Python include +=, *=, -=, /=, %=,
and **=. In all cases the augmented assignment "some_var <op>= other_var" is
equivalent to writing the normal assignment statement
"some_var = some_var <op> other_var".
