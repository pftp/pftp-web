unary subtraction
In Python, we can use the "unary minus" to negate a number:
<pre>
pos_num = 23
neg_num = -47
pow_num = -4**2
</pre>
The exponentiation operator takes precedence over the negation
operator if the negation operator is on its left. So in the
above example, the value of pow_num is -16.
