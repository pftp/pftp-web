### prompt
Write a function called pig_latin that takes a sentence string as its argument
and returns it with each of its words converted to pig latin. This means take
all consonants from the beginning of each word (if there are any) and move them
to the end of the word, and then append "ay" to the word. For example,
pig_latin("A great surprise") should return "Aay eatgray urprisesay".

### solution
function pig_latin(s) {
  var word_array = s.split(" ");
  for (var i = 0; i < word_array.length; i++) {
    var word = word_array[i];
    var first_consonants = '';
    var rest_word = word;
    for (var j = 0; j < word.length; j++) {
      var ch = word[j];
      if ('aeiouAEIOU'.indexOf(ch) != -1)
        break;
      first_consonants += ch;
      rest_word = rest_word.substring(1);
    }
    word_array[i] = rest_word + first_consonants + 'ay';
  }
  return word_array.join(' ');
}

### test
for (var x in {{ xs }})
  console.log(pig_latin(x));

### hint
Remember to check for upper as well as lower case letters when going through
each word looking for the first block of consonants.

### gen_template_vars
xs = rand_sentence_list(20)
for i, x in enumerate(xs):
  if random() < 0.5:
    xs[i] = x.upper()
res = {
  'xs': xs
}
