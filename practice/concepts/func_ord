ord function
The <b>chr function</b> takes an integer i as an argument and
returns a string of a single character whose ASCII code is i:
<pre>
some_char = chr(97)
print some_char          # prints 'a'
another_char = chr(74)
print another_char       # prints 'J'
</pre>
<p>
The argument must be in the range [0..255], inclusive; ValueError will be raised
if i is outside that range.

Here's a table mapping characters to their ASCII codes (we are only
concerned with the "Dec" and "Chr" columns):

The <b>ord function</b> takes a string of length one as an argument and returns
its ASCII code as an integer:
<pre>
some_ascii_code = ord('a')
print some_ascii_code          # prints 97
another_ascii_code = ord('J')
print another_ascii_code       # prints 74
</pre>
<p>
The ord function is the inverse of the chr function. So, if i is an integer,
we know ord(chr(x)) simply returns i back to us, and if ch is a character,
we know chr(ord(chr)) simply returns ch back to us.
