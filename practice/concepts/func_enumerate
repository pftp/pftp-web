enumerate function
The <b>enumerate function</b> helps us keep track of item indices as we iterate
through a string or list in a for loop:
<pre>
string_list = ['One fish', 'Two fish', 'Red fish', 'Blue fish']
for i, word_pair in enumerate(string_list):
  if word_pair == 'Red fish':
    print "The index of 'Red fish' is " + i
</pre>
<p>
The above code will print "The index of 'Red fish' is 2", since the string
"Red fish" is at index 2 in the string_list.
</p>
<p>
We can use the enumerate function in conjunction with the modulus operator to
handle iteration over every nth item of some list:
</p>
<pre>
num_list = [-8, 47, 3, -5, 23]
every_other_sum = 0
for i, num in enumerate(num_list):
  if i % 2 == 0:
    every_other_sum += num
print every_other_sum          # prints 18 (since -8+3+23=18)
</pre>
<p>
This code steps through every number in num_list, and whenever the
list index i (aka the list position) of that number is even, it adds the number
to our sum. Therefore our final sum consists of the numbers at positions 0, 2,
and 4 of num_list.
