if expression
<p>
An <b>if expression</b> is a way to put an if statement entirely on one
line:
</p>
<pre>
>>> jury_mood = 'sympathetic'
>>> verdict = 'innocent' if jury_mood == 'sympathetic' else 'guilty'
>>> emotion = 'distraught' if verdict == 'guilty' else 'elated'
>>> print 'the jury was feeling ' + jury_mood
the jury was feeling sympathetic
>>> print 'the verdict was ' + verdict
the verdict was innocent
>>> print 'the defendant was ' + emotion
the defendant was elated
</pre>
<p>
If expressions must be written on one line and are of the form
<pre>some_var = true_result if some_condition else false_result</pre>
after which some_var will be assigned to true_result if some_condition is true
and false_result otherwise.
</p>
