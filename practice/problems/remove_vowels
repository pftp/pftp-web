### prompt
Write a function called remove_vowels that takes a string as its argument and
returns it with all the vowels removed.

### solution
def remove_vowels(s):
  res = ''
  for char in s:
    if char not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
      res += char
  return res

### test
print remove_vowels('')
for x in {{ xs }}:
  print remove_vowels(x)

### hint
Here's a function called remove_consonants that takes a string as its argument
and returns it with all the consonants removed:
<pre>
def remove_consonants(s):
  res = ''
  for char in s:
    if char in 'aeiouAEIOU':
      res += char
  return res
</pre>

### gen_template_vars
xs = rand_string_list(20)
for i, x in enumerate(xs):
  if random() < 0.5:
    xs[i] = x.upper()
res = {
  'xs': xs
}
