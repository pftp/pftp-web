### prompt
Write a function called first_word that takes in a sentence as the argument and returns the first word of the sentence. Then write the following line to test if your function works "print first_word('{{ random_sentence:s1 }}')".

### solution
def first_word(sentence):
    return sentence.split(' ')[0]
print first_word('{{ random_sentence:s1 }}')

### test
print first_word('my pink pony')

### hint
Look at<a href="/cheatsheet.html"> this cheatsheet </a> and read about string manipulation (in particular the split method)!
<br>
To help you get started, below is a function called double that takes in one argument a and returns a * 2.
<pre>
def double(a):
   return a * 2
</pre>
