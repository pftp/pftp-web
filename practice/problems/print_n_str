### prompt
Write a function called print_n_{{ x }} that takes an integer as its argument
and prints "{{ x }}" that many times, on separate lines. The function should not
return anything.

### solution
def print_n_{{ x }}(n):
  for i in range(n):
    print '{{ x }}'

### test
for i in range(20):
  print print_n_{{ x }}(i)

### hint
Here's a function called print_9_x that takes a string as its argument and
prints it 5 times, on separate lines:
<pre>
def print_9_x(s):
  for i in range(9):
    print s
</pre>

### gen_template_vars
res = {
  'x': rand_word()
}
