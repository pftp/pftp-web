### prompt
Write a function called reverse_sentence that takes a sentence string as its argument and returns a new string with all the same words (separated by spaces) in reverse order that they appeared in the original string. You may assume all words are separated by a single space, and the setnence does not begin or end with any spaces.

### solution
def reverse_sentence(s):
  word_list = s.split()
  reverse_word_list = word_list[::-1]
  return ' '.join(reverse_word_list)

### test
print reverse_sentence('')
for s in {{ x }}:
  print reverse_sentence(s)

### hint
Here's code for the every_other_word function that takes a string as its
argument returns a new string made out of every other word of the string,
using 'extended slices' in Python:
<pre>
def every_other_word(s):
  word_list = s.split()
  every_other_word_list = word_list[::2]
  return ' '.join(every_other_word_list)
</pre>

### gen_template_vars
res = {
  'x': rand_sentence_list(20)
}
