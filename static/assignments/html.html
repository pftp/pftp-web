Now we're going to learn HTML! For this entire section, keep in mind that
HTML is an entirely new language. It has nothing to do with Python!
HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language", and it is the stuff webpages
are made of.
<br><br>
Get started by downloading the file
<a href="my_fantastic_webpage.html">my_fantastic_webpage.html</a>.
In order to download it, right-click and click on <b>Save Link As...</b>
Then specify an appropriate folder to save it in.
<br><br>
Now, in the Terminal, navigate to where you just downloaded the file
and type <b>open my_fantastic_webpage.html</b>. The file should open in
a web browser, and you should see just the word "Awesomesauce!" at the top
of the page. Also, the browser tab should be titled "Look I'm the Title!".
<br><br>
IMPORTANT: The URL should start with "file:///" as opposed to
"http://". This is how you know you're opening the file on your own
machine rather than on the Internet.
<br><br>
Now, open my_fantastic_webpage.html in a text editor of your choice (such as
AquaMacs). It should look like this:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
&#60;html&#62;

&#60;head&#62;
&#60;title&#62;Look I'm the Title!&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;

&#60;body&#62;
Awesomesauce!
&#60;/body&#62;

&#60;/html&#62;</pre>
First, notice that every html command is enclosed within the '&#60;' and
'&#62;' symbols. We call these commands "tags". Notice that the tags are
all paired! Each html block starts with "&#60some_tag_name&#62" and ends with
"&#60/some_tag_name&#62". For example, we put "Look I'm the Title!" inside the
start and end "title" tags, so that means it's the title.
<br><br>
Also, we can nest these tags. Notice how the title tags are nested inside
the head tags, which in turn are nested inside the html tags that enclose
the entire document!
<br><br>
Now, most of the action goes on inside the body tag of our HTML files.
This is what actually gets displayed in the body of the page. In
our file we currently have only a single word (Awesomesauce!) inside our
body.
<br><br>
Let's change that. Replace the line "Awesomesauce!" with
"&#60;h1&#62;Awesomesauce!&#60;/h1&#62;". Save your file in your text editor,
and reload the webpage in your browser. The word "Awesomesauce!" should have
gotten a lot bigger. The "h1" tag stands for "header 1". There are
actually six different sizes of headers in HTML, h1 through h6. Try them
out!
<br><br>
Now let's learn some more tags! Change your HTML file to look like this:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
&#60;html&#62;

&#60;head&#62;
&#60;title&#62;Look I'm the Title!&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;

&#60;body&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Awesomesauce!&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;h4 style="color:red;"&#62;Redsauce!&#60;/h4&#62;
&#60;p&#62;
This is text inside a paragraph.&#60;br&#62;
This is more text inside the paragraph.
&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;a href="http://www.google.com"&#62;Click me to go to Google&#60;/a&#62;
&#60;/body&#62;

&#60;/html&#62;</pre>
Here we introduced a few new tags. The "p" tag denotes a paragraph where
we can put multiple lines of text. The "br" tag makes a new line on our
webpage. Note that "br" is an exception to the "tags are paired"
rule, since it simply creates a newline and therefore does not have to
enclose anything. Finally, the "a" tag specifies a link to another
webpage.
<br><br>
Here we also introduced tag attributes, which are very important! A tag
attribute is something other than the tag name inside the tag which
changes the default behavior of the tag in some way. Above, we put
'style="color:red;"' inside the "h4" tag to turn the text red, and we put
'href="http://www.google.com"' inside the "a" tag to specify that the link
will take us to the Google homepage.
<br><br>
Note that tag attributes are always in the starting tag, and always follow
the same pattern (attribute="something"). We can also have multiple
attributes inside a single tag! For example try changing the "a" tag to
read
<pre>
      &#60;a style="color:green;" href="http://www.google.com"&#62;Click me to go to Google&#60;/a&#62;</pre>
We only have a couple more things to learn. Update your HTML file again:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
&#60;html&#62;

&#60;head&#62;
&#60;title&#62;Look I'm the Title!&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;

&#60;body&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Awesomesauce!&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;h4 style="color:red;"&#62;Redsauce!&#60;/h4&#62;
&#60;p&#62;
This is text inside a paragraph.&#60;br&#62;
This is more text inside the paragraph.
&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;a style="color:green;" href="http://www.google.com"&#62;Click me to go to Google&#60;/a&#62;
&#60;div id="my-div" style="border:2px solid yellow;"&#62;
  &#60;span class="happy-fun-class" style="color:red;font-style:italic;"&#62;Hooray!&#60;/span&#62;
  &#60;span class="sad-boring-class" style="color:blue;"&#62;Sadface :(&#60;/span&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;/body&#62;

&#60;/html&#62;</pre>
We've introduced the "div" and "span" tags. These are important because
they make up the bulk of most modern webpages. A "div" specifies a
bounding box for content to go in. Notice that we put a yellow border
around it so you can see exactly how far it extends. A "span" delimits a
segment of text. Notice that our two spans are right next to each other on
the page, but we can still style them differently!
<br><br>
We also intrduced the "id" and "class" attributes here. For web scraping,
these attributes are very useful because they tend to identify similar
things on a given page. But we'll get into web scraping next week.
<br><br>
Finally, let's add an image to our page. First, download this image:
<a href="hurshal.jpg">hurshal.jpg</a>. Remember, right-click and select
<b>Save Link As...</b> to download the image. Make sure to save it in the same
folder as your html file! Then, update your html:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
&#60;html&#62;

&#60;head&#62;
&#60;title&#62;Look I'm the Title!&#60;/title&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;

&#60;body&#62;
&#60;h1&#62;Awesomesauce!&#60;/h1&#62;
&#60;h4 style="color:red;"&#62;Redsauce!&#60;/h4&#62;
&#60;p&#62;
This is text inside a paragraph.&#60;br&#62;
This is more text inside the paragraph.
&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;a style="color:green;" href="http://www.google.com"&#62;Click me to go to Google&#60;/a&#62;
&#60;div id="my-div" style="border:2px solid yellow;"&#62;
  &#60;span class="happy-fun-class" style="color:red;font-style:italic;"&#62;Hooray!&#60;/span&#62;
  &#60;span class="sad-boring-class" style="color:blue;"&#62;Sadface :(&#60;/span&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;h3&#62;Haha look it's Hurshal!&#60;/h3&#62;
&#60;img src="hurshal.jpg" width="800" /&#62;
&#60;/body&#62;

&#60;/html&#62;</pre>
Note that the image tag is another exception to the "tags are paired" rule. All
image tags must have a "src" attribute, which is the path for the desired image.
Also, we can optionally specify a width and/or height for our images (we
had to do that in this case because otherwise the image of Hurshal is too big).

Remember, right-click and select <b>Save Link As...</b> to download the

  <li>Include a numbered list of the top three superpowers you would have if
  you could choose any and a bullet list under each number of what you would use

  <li>Put at least one image on your page (perhaps of you, perhaps of your
  favorite animal, or of anything else) and make the image a link, so clicking
