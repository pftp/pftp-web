<h3> Welcome to Lab 5! We are going to learn about the Terminal and for loops today. Hit the 'Next' button to get started. </h3>
<br><br>
For the past couple weeks, you have been using the built in Python editor on the website.
Now its time to introduce you to your new best friend! The terminal. This will make you
approximately %1337 more hardcore and you can have one of those screens with tiny green
text on a black background and start hacking into mainframes and so on.
<br><br>
Ok just kidding. But you will be able to use a terminal, which is a pretty useful skill,
as we'll get into later.
<br><br>
You can think of the terminal as the hood of a car. Most of the things that you can
do with a car can be done without opening the hood, but if you want to be able to harness
the full power of the car, you'll need to pop the hood and take a look at the engine inside!
The terminal is your point of access to all the functionality of the computer, albeit in
text form. This can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it,
you'll notice that it's significantly faster to type some things into a terminal than it
is to click around with your mouse.
<br><br>
Let's take a look at what you can do with a terminal. Open up a new terminal by clicking
on the magnifying glass in the top right of the screen and typing 'Terminal' into
the search bar. You should get a white window with some text like `haas [1] ~ >`.
This is the prompt of the terminal which waits for you to type something and hit enter to run it.
<br><br>
Try typing `ls` and hit enter. This should list all the folders in the current
folder for you.
Now try typing `cd Downloads` and hit enter. This should let you enter the Downloads folder.
If you run `ls` now, you should see that it will list the contents of the Downloads folder.
<br><br>
Now you can move up a folder by typing `cd ..`.
Heres a cool trick: if you type `cd Dow` and hit tab, the terminal
will try to autocomplete the command with folders that start with 'Dow'.
You can also move several folders deep by typing `cd folder1/folder2/folder3`
(you can type a couple letters for each on and hit tab to complete the folder name)
<br><br>
Using these commands, you can navigate around folders on your computer!
Practice navigating around the computer until you're comfortable with it.
If you're a fast typer, you'll notice that it's faster to move around folders like
this than it is to click on them in a file navigator window.
<br><br>
Here's some more useful commands: `rm FILENAME` will delete the file
FILENAME and `rm -rf FOLDER` will delete the folder FOLDER.
<b>NOT SO FUN FACT:</b> The `rm -rf` command is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. It
will PERMANENTLY delete the folder you use it on as well as any folders inside that
folder. You can delete your entire file system using this command. So use it with
utmost caution.
<b>FUN FACT:</b> The r in `-rf` tells the `rm`
command to <b>recursively</b> delete the folder and all it's subfolders.
If you're curious, the code for this would look something like:
<pre>
def delete(folder):
  if empty(folder):
    #some code to delete the empty folder
  else:
    #recursively delete all it's contents first
    delete(folder.subfolder1)
    delete(folder.subfolder2)
    delete(folder.subfolder3) #...etc
    #some code to delete folder after you emptied it
</pre>
<br><br>
Now you can also create folders using the `mkdir` command.
Type `cd` and hit enter. When you don't provide a folder after `cd`,
it will move to your home folder. In this folder, type `mkdir lab5`, which will
create a folder called 'lab5'. Then `cd` into the lab5 folder. If you `ls`
in this folder, you'll notice that it is empty. We'll fix that now.
<br><br>
This is where you will be working on your code for this lab. Now we want to create
a file and start putting some Python code into it. Type `touch first.py`
The `touch` command will create an empty file named 'first.py'. The file
extension for Python files is .py, so we generally put that at the end of the filename.
<br><br>
Now we should put some code inside this file! Break out your favorite text editor
(Aquamacs, TextEdit, Notepad, but not Word) and add the following code:

<pre>print 'I am so h4x I can use the terminal like a G'</pre>
and then save the file.
<br><br>
Now going back to your terminal, you can check the contents of the file using
`cat first.py`, which will just print the contents of the file into the
terminal. If you saved the file, it should be exactly what you typed.
Now for the fun part. Let's run this code! The command for that is (surprisingly)
`python first.py`, which should run the code and print out
'I am so h4x I can use the terminal like a G'
<br><br>
Coolio, you just ran your first Python program locally! This is extremely powerful
because now you can write programs and have them run on your own computer and interact
with your own files, instead of just running them on the website.
Now try copying an existing program or homework from the website into a file and run it
with the `python` command.
<br><br>
Awesome, now there's one more feature of Python which we haven't seen yet: the interpreter.
If you type `python` with no filename, you will end up in the Python interpreter.
You should see it print some information like the version of python and then
a `>>>` prompt will appear. You interact with this similar to how you interact
with the terminal, but this prompt understands Python code! It will run each
line that you type. Try typing the following lines, hitting enter in between:
<pre>
print 'hi'
a = 1
a
f = a * 3
print f
import turtle
winston = turtle.Turtle()
winston.forward(100)
winston.write('hi im in an interpreter')
</pre>
<br><br>
You can hit Ctrl-D or type `exit()` to quit the interpreter and go back to t
to the terminal.
<br><br>
Now that you know how to use a terminal, go post a facebook
status/tweet/vine/whatever you kids do these days with a picture of your terminal
and show off your hacker skillz, yo
