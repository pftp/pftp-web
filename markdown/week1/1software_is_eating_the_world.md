he provides example after example of how software is critical to the success of
the most successful businesses in the world. And in addition to disrupting every
major industry, software is now ubiquitous in the lives of nearly every

changed how we interact with the world and with each other, and underneath all
those shiny apps is a whole ton of code. We think it is very important that you
as users of these apps and online services understand at some deeper level how
they really work. We hope that through this course you will change from a
passive consumer of this technology to an active participant in the development
of it. In other words, you will move from computer user to computer hacker. You
will no longer be constrained by the shiny box that Apple or Google provides for
you, rather you will be able to manipulate your devices as you see fit, to solve
problems that you identify in the world around you. All that this requires is
a bit of hard work and a whole ton of patience.
